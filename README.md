# Wholesale-Club


A program that services members of Wholesale Club.

Wholesale Club has two types of members: basic and preferred. 
Member information includes:
  - Name
  - Member number
  - Membership type
  - Membership expiration date
  - Total amount spent
  - Rebate amount (preferred members only)

A rebate of 5% of the total amount spent (not to include sales tax) is paid at the close of the year to the preferred members. Basic members pay annual dues of $60.00 and preferred members pay annual dues of $75.00. Your program will use the following files that will be provided:

A membership information file that will contain the member name, member number, membership type, and expiration date

Five sales files that contain details of member shopping for a day (member number, items purchased and prices - items not to exceed 100 on any given trip)

Your program should read from the daily sales file and update the membersâ€™ information accordingly. As the sales are processed, the total amount spent and rebate data for each member should be updated. Assume a sales tax rate of 8.75%.


Generate the following reports/request at any time:

(1) A sales report for any given day. It should include a list of items and quantities sold on that day as well as names of the members who shopped that day.  Report the total revenue for the given day.  It should also include the number of preferred members and basic members who shopped during the given day.

(2) A yearly sales report.  It should include a list of the items and quantities sold in the given year.  Report the total revenue for the given year.  The report should highlight the best performing items as well as the worst performing items for the year.

(3) A user should be able to enter a membership number or name and get a list of the total purchases per that member.

(4) A report that prints the total purchases by all the members sorted by membership number.  It should also include a grand total of the purchases.

(5) A user should be able to enter an item name and get the quantity of that item sold as well as the total sales price.

(6) A report that prints out the quantity of each item sold sorted by item name.

(7) A report that prints out the rebate of all the preferred members sorted by membership number.

(8) A report showing the amount per year paid by each member for the membership dues sorted by member type (basic/preferred and then by member name.)

(9) A user should be able to enter a month and get a list of all members whose memberships expire that month as well as their dues amount.

(10) A user should be able to add/delete members.   Create purchases for the new members to validate your code.  Updates should be saved between executions.

(11) Determine if any basic customer should convert their membership to preferred status.
